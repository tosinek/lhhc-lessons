    <p><strong>Swing Kong Dance Orchestra</strong> is a newly established 1930s style big band based in Brno, Czech Republic, which aims to play 1930s style swing music with authentic sound, steady dancing rhythm and stirring arrangements that will excite both traditional jazz lovers (that we are) as well as Lindy hoppers and other swing dancers (that we are, too). Amongst our greatest influencers are the orchestras of Jimmie Lunceford, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Chick Webb, Cab Calloway, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Harry James, and many more, from the era of 1930s and early 1940s - the era when the Lindy hop was born. Last but not least, don't you think they look great in custom tailored suits on the stage? You simply must see them live!</p>
    <p><strong>Pilsner Jazz Band</strong>, in the 16 years of its existence, the band has become an integral part of the Czech swing scene. They regularly take part in festivals all over the Czech Republic and in many European countries (Sweden, Switzerland, Latvia, Poland, Germany, ...), in January 2020 the band had great success in the USA (Virginia, Washington DC, New York). The core of the repertoire consists of arranged swing compositions by orchestras by Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Glenn Miller, but also a Dixieland of the so-called Chicago style. In 2021 the band released their fourth CD, a recording from a concert in Washington - <em>Live at the Kennedy Center</em>.&nbsp;<strong >Pilsner Jazz Band is the organizer of the Lindy Hop Herbs Camp</strong>, as well as the International Dixieland Festival Pilsen and regular swing dance evenings "After the siren swing!".</p>
